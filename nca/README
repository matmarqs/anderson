The directory "src" just contains the source code of the "nca" executable.
You can type "make" inside it to compile the program again.

The directory "bin" contains only the executables and input files.
I wrote the script "bin/run.sh" that runs "nca" given the files "Ac.inp" and "sig.inp"
The usage is "./run.sh $ACFILE $SIGINP"
The script will generate a "output" directory that contains all nca's output.
It will also create a "backup_sig" directory that storages previously used "sig.inp" files

Finally, the script "clean.sh" just does "rm -rf output ; rm -rf backup_sig".
